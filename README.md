- What is it?
A small Bug Bounty scanner that I have been working on to not only make doing bug bounties easier but to help other small bug bounty enthuasiasts.
- Keep in mind
I am not an expert coder so there will probably be a ton of bugs and if something bad happens to your system I am not liable. But nothing should just a quick disclaimer.
## Usage

```
chmod +x setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh
```

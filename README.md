- What is it?

A small Bug Bounty scanner that I have been working on to not only make doing bug bounties easier but to help other small bug bounty enthuasiasts.
- Keep in mind

I am not an expert coder so there will probably be a ton of bugs and if something bad happens to your system I am not liable. But nothing should just a quick disclaimer.
## Usage 
- Before first use do the following:
```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
- Usage
```
./scanner.sh -h
